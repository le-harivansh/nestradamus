# Features

This file documents proposed features to the application; and acceptance or rejection thereof.

## Proposals

#### Event Sourcing [REJECTED]

##### Proposal

_Implement an `event-sourcing` architecture in the application._

##### Counter-argument

This application is meant to be used as a starting framework for R&D projects where the end product will most likely vastly differ from where the application started.

It is meant to be used in an environment where the business requirements are constantly changing.

Therefore, implementing an event-sourcing system into the application at this stage would bring about more friction during the development process than any (purported) benefits.
