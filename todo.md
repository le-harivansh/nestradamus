# Todo

- [ ] Add a visual indication in the module directory names to distinguish them from regular directories in a module. (Maybe prefix them with an underscore?)
- [ ] Create a script to generate the `access-token` secret in the `.env` file and/or in the application (shell) environment.
- [ ] Create a script to generate the `refresh-token` secret in the `.env` file and/or in the application (shell) environment.
- [ ] Create a script to _pretty-print_ the application's routes.

- [ ] Architect the application to use an event-based system.
- [ ] Adding application-level logging.
- [ ] Rename `User` to `Customer`.

- [ ] Implement healthchecks for the application (using [terminus](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus)?).

- [ ] Add CORS to the application.
- [ ] Look into [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet), and if it suits the application, setup [helm](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/helmet).

- [ ] Implement [rate-limiting](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/rate-limiting) into the API.
