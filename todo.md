# Todo

- [ ] Implement ACL for administrators.
- [ ] Add CLI command to add an administrator (with options to choose the desired "level"; e.g.: "superadmin" et al.).
- [ ] Add administration routes to:
  - [ ] manage administrator roles/permissions
  - [ ] CRUD administrators
  - [ ] CRUD users

### Later

Features to be implemented later - when they would actually be used by the application:

- **Route-parameter binding** - similar to that of Laravel
- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)**
- **Dynamic throttler**
